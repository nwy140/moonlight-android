## This repo is a merge of these 2 repository below  
https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/moonlight-android  
https://github.com/lyc8503/moonlight-android-no-keyboard-shortcut

## Why I made this fork
I realized that bluetooth keyboard/touchpad combo works better on artemis
But I could not perform alt tab on my xiaomi pad 7, but alt tab works well on the no-keyboard-shortcut repo with its accessibility setting, you might also need to allow restricted settings in the App's settings. The shortcuts also seems to work better on Xiaomi Pad 7 Workstation Mode.

So I decided to just merge these 2 repos together to get the best of both features

## https://github.com/lyc8503/moonlight-android-no-keyboard-shortcut

This is an unofficial fork of Moonlight Android, which adds an accessibility keyboard service not yet supported by the upstream due to Google Play compliance. This allows you to use common key operations such as Win, Esc, Alt+Tab on the remote host without triggering the Android system's keyboard shortcut.

To use this fork, you need to download the pre-built APK file from the latest Actions build entry in this project and install it (of course, you can also pull the source code and build it yourself according to the upstream build method).

After the initial installation, you need to manually open the settings, find the accessibility settings, and manually enable the Moonlight Physical Keyboard Service. After that, you can normally connect to the remote host and use the shortcuts on the physical keyboard.

Artemis Android will allow you to stream your collection of games from your Windows PC to your Android device,

Artemis is currently the best fork of Moonlight with loads of optimizations for office usage.

A more seamless experience with virtual display will be Artemis paired with [Apollo](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo).

# Disclaimer

This is the `go away` version of Moonlight Android.

I got kicked from Moonlight and Sunshine's Discord server literally for helping people out.

This is what I got for finding a bug, opened an issue, getting no response, troubleshoot myself, fixed the issue myself, shared it by PR to the main repo hoping my efforts can help someone else during the maintainance gap.

Yes, I'm going away. Fixes and improvements on this fork are not necessarily be merged to the main repo either. I have also started [a fork of Sunshine called Apollo](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo) and will add useful features that will never get merged by the main repo shortly. [Apollo](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo) and [Moonlight Noir](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/moonlight-android) will no longer be compatible with OG Sunshine and OG Moonlight eventually, but they'll work even better with much more carefully designed features.

The main repo had stayed silent for 5 months, with nobody actually responding to issues, and people are getting totally no help besides the limited FAQ in their Discord server. I tried to answer issues and questions, solve problems within my ablilty but I got kicked out just for helping others.

**PRs for feature improvements are welcomed here unlike the main repo, your ideas are more likely to be appreciated and your efforts are actually being respected. We welcome people who can and willing to share their efforts, helping yourselves and other people in need.**

**Update**: They have contacted me and apologized for this incident, but the fact it **happened** still motivated me to start my own fork.
